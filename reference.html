                        <h4>Please Note:</h4>  
                        <p>There were issues with responsiveness for this design. Although not all sections
                         are behaving resposively, for the most part the content and sections are responding
                         to different size devices. There was however the slight problem of my side-nav not
                         collapsing to mobile-size and as we re-size the screen it seems to dissapear 
                         completely.
                        </p> 
                        <p>There were also some features I really wanted in here but as time was constantly against
                         me, they were not implemented. The following were areas needed for improvement:
                        </p>

                                <li>Map/Contact Location in the Footer Section</li>
                                <li>Better Imagery for Projects Section</li>
